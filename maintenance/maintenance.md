## Securing Your WordPress Site
We would start with an *initial consultation* of your current site at *$50*.  This would include:

  - **Verifying plugins and theme are up to date**
  - **Quick look for possible faults in code**
  - **Identify other plugins that may help secure your website further**
  - **Recommendations to secure your site**

If you decide to use us to secure your site, we would begin the work identified in the initial consultation at **$75/hour**.  Depending on the areas identified in the consultation, the entire process could take between 1-4 days.

## Ongoing WordPress Maintenance
This is for our small business owners that want to ensure their plugins and themes are always up to date or maybe want to know their site is being properly backed up.  The following options are available:

  - **Maintaining regular backups for your site** (**$20/backup**)
  - **Confirm or update themes and plugins** (**$75/hour**)

\* Check out our [additional services](http://mikefontenot.me/migration/basic#additional) offered for continued service from us.
