## Securing Your WordPress Site
We would start with an *initial consultation* of your current site at *$50*.  This would include:

  - **Verifying plugins and theme are up to date**
  - **Quick look for possible faults in code**
  - **Identify other plugins that may help secure your website further**
  - **Recommendations to secure your site**

If you decide to use us to secure your site, we would begin the work identified in the initial consultation at **$75/hour**.  Depending on the areas identified in the consultation, the entire process could take between 1-4 days.

## Additional WordPress Services / Maintenance

  - **Maintain regular backups for your site** (**$20/backup** - check out our ongoing support below for savings)
  - **Confirm or update themes and plugins** (**$75/hour** - check out our ongoing support below for savings)

  - **Ongoing Support/Updates** â€“ It is possible that you may be too busy running your business that you would prefer us to take care of your new WordPress site in a permanent capacity.  This option would allow us to make unlimited content changes on your site, minor development improvements, manage WordPress backups, updates, and security, and be available via phone to answer questions you have, and be a partner in your team.  We can also include monthly analytics reports with suggestions for improving your site.  Starting at **$250 per month per website**.
