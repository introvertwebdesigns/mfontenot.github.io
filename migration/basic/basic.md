We are here to help get your site moved over to WordPress.  The basic migration service is perfect for almost all websites to get you up and running quickly.

Here are some guidelines when deciding if you require the basic migration service:

  - **Less than 50 Pages** – The basic migrations are done by hand, moving over all of your content to ensure accuracy and functionality.
  - **Simple Site Functionality** – A basic migration brings over your simple site elements like email subscriptions and contact forms and includes very little, if any, interactive functionality.
  - **Little Complexity** – WordPress migrations can be complex, but a basic migration is not. If you believe your project is complex, then visit the [advanced migration service](http://mikefontenot.me/migration/advanced) for more information.  You can still fill out the form below and we can talk it through and decide the best fit for your project.

## Basic Migration Service Overview

Your site migration should be a smooth process with little or no headache on your part. Here is an overview of how a basic migration would be carried out:

  1. **Website Evaluation** – We will take a close look at your existing site to prepare for the migration. We look carefully through each of the pages taking notes to ask the right questions before getting started.
  2. **Follow-up Consultation** – We schedule a follow-up call where we present suggestions, ask my questions, answer your questions, and make my recommendations to move forward.
  2. **Setting Up WordPress** – Work starts to get WordPress up and running, configuring all settings, and install needed plugins.
  3. **Importing Content** – All your site's content is carefully moved over to your new WordPress site. We will create and use a shared spreadsheet to track the migration progress.
  4. **Existing Design Migration** – At this point, we would carry over the existing design into a new custom WordPress theme, with the same design feel, but now powered by WordPress.
  5. **Website Review** – Here is where we conduct a full review of all your migrated pages and prepare the site for the launch.
  6. **Go-Live** – This is the best and most exciting part, for you and me!  We will manage the switch from your old site to your new WordPress site, making sure that any changed URLs are being redirected and that your site is up and running successful.

## Migration Service Extras

Our goal is to create the best migration service experience. To only give you the migration and leave you to dry would be a disservice to you and me and is why we also offer the following (included ***free***):

  - **Free Training** – WordPress is fairly intuitive, meaning you may need a small amount of training to get on your feet.  We can work out small training sessions via phone or screen sharing online.
  - **Free Answers** – Send us an [email](http://mikefontenot.me/contact) or give us a call throughout the migration process to answer any questions you have.
  - **Free Recommendations** – We can also give you recommendations on how to make WordPress work for you to give you maximum results to run your business.

## Price & Payments

The basic migration service is $2,500.

Upon acceptance of your project and your confirmation of the project schedule and timeline, we will send you an invoice for the full amount, due before the work begins.

We accept payment via Dwolla (preferred) or PayPal.

We offer discounts to non-profit organizations.

## Additional Services

While the migrations services are the main part of our business, you can purchase additional services at special prices after migration is complete. These are a few additional services we offer:

  - **Ongoing Support/Updates** – It is possible that you may be too busy running your business that you would prefer us to take care of your new WordPress site in a permanent capacity.  This option would allow us to make unlimited content changes on your site, minor development improvements, manage WordPress backups, updates, and security, and be available via phone to answer questions you have, and be a partner in your team.  We can also include monthly analytics reports with suggestions for improving your site.  Starting at $250 per month per website.
