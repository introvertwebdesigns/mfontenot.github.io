### Basic Migration Service ###

This is for you if you have a simple website containing only a few pages with basic items such as, pictures, contact forms, and basic text.  We will start with a personal consultation to review your site and what you need brought over to your new WordPress site.  Then, we will begin the migration process by setting up WordPress with your hosting provider and importing all your existing content.  After this is done, we will migrate your current design and present the newly migrated site to you.  Finally (after approval, of course), we will go live with your new WordPress site!

This process can take between **2 & 3** weeks with prices starting at **$2,500** for the entire site.

If a basic migration is what you need, please visit the [Basic Migration Service](http://mikefontenot.me/migration/basic) to view more information and tell me more about your project.
