I'm here to help get your site moved to WordPress.  The basic migration service is perfect for almost all websites to get you up and running quickly.

Here are some guidelines when deciding if you require the basic migration service:

  - **Less than 20 Pages** – The basic migrations are done by hand, moving over all of your content to ensure accuracy and functionality.
  - **Simple Site Functionality** – A basic migration brings over your simple site elements like email subscriptions and contact forms and includes very little, if any, interactive functionality.
  - **Little Complexity** – WordPress migrations can be complex, but a basic migration is not. If you believe your project is complex, then visit the [advanced migration service](http://mikefontenot.me/migration/advanced) for more information.  You can still fill out the form below and we can talk it through and decide the best fit for your project.

Basic Migration Service Overview

Your site migration should be a smooth process with little or no headache on your part. Here is an overview of how a basic migration would be carried out:

  1. **Website Evaluation** – I will take a close look at your existing site to prepare for the migration. I look carefully through each of the pages taking notes to ask the right questions before getting started.
  2. **Follow-up Consultation** – We schedule a follow-up call where I present suggestions, ask my questions, answer your questions, and make my recommendations to move forward.
  2. **Setting Up WordPress** – Work starts to get WordPress up and running, configuring all settings, and install needed plugins.
  3. **Importing Content** – All your site's content is carefully moved over to your new WordPress site. We will create and use a shared spreadsheet to track the migration progress.
    Design Migration – With your content in place, we now carry over the existing design into a new custom WordPress theme, giving you the same look and feel of your existing website, but now powered by WordPress.
    Website Review – Next, we conduct a careful review of all the migrated pages and then prepare the website for launch.
    Going Live – Last, but not least, we manage the switch from your old site to your new, WordPress-powered site, making sure that any changed URLs are successfully redirected. The work is done!

Included Extras

Our goal is to create a great service experience. Accordingly, while we’re managing all the technical parts of the migration, we also offer the following:

    Free Training – The beauty of WordPress is that it requires no prior experience and very little training before you’re able to maximize what it has to offer. If you haven’t used WordPress before or just need a refresher, we’ve got you covered. We offer custom recorded screencasts and screen sharing sessions to provide you (and your team!) with all the training you need.
    Free Answers – If you’ve got questions about WordPress, ask away. We are only an email or a phone call away throughout the migration process to answer any questions you have about putting WordPress to work for you – at no charge!
    Free Recommendations – If you’d like ideas or suggestions about how you can take WordPress further, we’ve got you covered. We offer a free, no obligation consultation where we get to know your business objectives and offer you ideas and suggestions for putting WordPress to work to get results for you.

Pricing & Payments

A basic WordPress migration is $2,500.

Payment details are simple. Upon acceptance of your project and confirmation of the project schedule/timeline, I’ll send you an invoice for the full amount, due before the work begins.

I accept payment via Dwolla (preferred), PayPal, credit card, check, wire transfer, and bartering (depending on what’s being offered).

By the way, I do occasionally offer discounts to non-profit organizations. Just ask.
Additional Services

I do have more to offer! Along with a WordPress migration you can purchase additional services at special prices. Here’s an overview of what I offer:

    Ongoing Support / Oversight – How would you like to have my team and I at your service on an ongoing basis? You can use us to make unlimited content updates to your site, minor development improvements, manage WordPress backups, updates, and security, and just generally be available to pick up the phone, answer questions you have, and be an extension of your team. We also include a monthly analytics report along with any relevant recommendations for improvement. Prices start at $250 per month per website.
    New WordPress Theme – Want to migrate your website to WordPress yet don’t really care for your current design? We can help you get a new look! We can work with you to build a new design from scratch or, most likely, we’ll help you choose an existing WordPress theme, then install it and customize it to meet your needs and make sure it works with your existing content. Implementing and customizing an existing WordPress theme starts at $1000. Building a new theme from scratch starts at $5,000.
    Custom Development – Do you have a feature that you’d like to add to your new WordPress-powered website? Let’s talk! Most minor development requests can be scoped and included within the context of a basic WordPress migration. Tell me what you have in mind and I’ll give you my recommendations along with a scope and estimate accordingly. Minor custom development typically starts at $500.
