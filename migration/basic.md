## WordPress Migration Service ##

Do you need your current site migrated into WordPress?  Do you want to understand the benefits of using WordPress over your current site?  Take a look at these two migration services below and give me a shout so we can get started.

### Basic Migration Service ###

This is for you if you have a simple website containing only a few pages with basic items such as, pictures, contact forms, and basic text.  We will start with a personal consultation to review your site and what you need brought over to your new WordPress site.  Then, we will begin the migration process by setting up WordPress with your hosting provider and importing all your existing content.  After this is done, we will migrate your current design and present the newly migrated site to you.  Finally (after approval, of course), we will go live with your new WordPress site!

This process can take between **2 & 3** weeks with prices starting at **$2,500** for the entire site.

If a basic migration is what you need, please visit the [Basic Migration Service](http://mikefontenot.me/migration/basic) to view more information and tell me more about your project.

### Advanced Migration Service ###

I offer an advanced migration service for large or very complex websites requiring specialized importing of your content or that have other needs not mentioned in the basic migration service.

An advanced migration can take between **1 & 2** months to complete with prices starting at **$10,000** for the entire site.

Visit the [Advanced Migration Service](http://mikefontenot.me/migration/advanced) to learn more about the offering and tell me about your project. 

You may have questions before filling out the form.  Please feel free to [email](http://mikefontenot.me/contact) me first.
