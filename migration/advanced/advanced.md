While the basic migration service will cover almost any website, you may have decided that the advanced migration service is the way to go.  It depends, and we invite you to take a look at the guidelines below before making this investment.

Here are some guidelines when deciding if you require the basic migration service:

  - **50 Pages or more + advanced functionality** – Just because your site has over 50 pages may not mean you qualify for the advanced migration, but add more advanced features your current site has and you would probably need this service.  An example of advanced functionality would be: advanced database(s), advanced Javascript or other scripts needed in your new WordPress site, and "I had a developer create this cool 'something or other' and I need that in WordPress".  [Contact](http://mikefontenot.me/contact) us to find out if you fit this.
  - **Advanced Functionality** – Your site is out of control (just kidding) with functionality.  An example of this would be: a store with inventory control, advanced payments on your site, or just all around the most advanced site that your developer ever built.  We can [talk](http://mikefontenot.me/contact) about this before the decision is made to go with this service.
  - **Other** - There may be something you identify during our initial review of your site.

## Advanced Migration Service Overview

You have spent time with a developer, or yourself, and built the most impressive and complex site for your business and want that evaluated and migrated correctly the first time.  We want you to be happy with this service and your new site and will work hard to get you there.  Since this is the most expensive option, we will work with you very closely before deciding this is the path we take.

Here is our idea of how we should plan this process.

  - **Contact Us** – The first step is to contact us to talk about your project (include a link to the site you plan to migrate). You can send me an [email](http://mikefontenot.me/contact) or give me a call at 337-577-(one)683 (we will return calls within 24 hours on working days).
  - **10-15 Minute Site Review** – After hearing from you, we will take a 10-15 minute look at your existing site and determine if it is a match for the advanced migration service.  We will gather questions along with our initial recommendations at this stage.
  - **Initial Consultation** – After the review, we can schedule a call to discuss findings, get answers to our questions, and also answer your questions. Here is where we can discuss pricing and timeline and make sure that we are a match for each other (it is possible we may not be, and that is okay).  If we decide to move forward, you will need to pay for a website evaluation and reserve your place on our schedule.
  - **Website Evaluation** – Now that we decided to start together, we can take care of the site evaluation at a scheduled time. During the evaluation, We will work carefully through each page on your site, identify the functionality needed, make note of the areas we have questions, and put together a detailed plan of work that needs to be completed. This is the most important part of the process and we will provide you with a candid evaluation. We will finally present the findings and recommendations to you as a detailed plan of work, with a fixed cost for us to carry out that work and the timeline for completion.

## Migration Service Extras

These free extras can be found on our [Basic Migration Services](http://mikefontenot.me/migration/basic#extras) page.

## Prices & Payments

The advanced migration service starts at $10,000 because of the intensity of the process.  We ask that you read both [Basic](http://mikefontenot.me/migration/basic) & [Advanced](http://mikefontenot.me/migration/advanced) Migration Services to decide if this one would be a good fit.

Due to the nature of this service, cost is variable and is unique to each site.  Just to give you an idea, the website evaluation above is $500.  That pays for some of the time we spend doing the research and planning for your migration project and will secure your spot on our schedule.  The cost for the migration itself will be in the $5,500 – $10,000 range.

We can discuss invoicing and payment during the website evaluation step.

We accept payment via Dwolla (preferred) or PayPal.

We offer discounts to non-profit organizations.
