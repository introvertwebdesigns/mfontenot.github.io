While the basic migration service will cover almost any website, you may have decided that the advanced migration service is the way to go.  It depends, and we invite you to take a look at the guidelines below before making this investment.

Here are some guidelines when deciding if you require the basic migration service:

  - **50 Pages or more + advanced functionality** – Just because your site has over 50 pages may not mean you qualify for the advanced migration, but add more advanced features your current site has and you would probably need this service.  An example of advanced functionality would be: advanced database(s), advanced Javascript or other scripts needed in your new WordPress site, and "I had a developer create this cool 'something or other' and I need that in WordPress".  [Contact](http://mikefontenot.me/contact) us to find out if you fit this.
  - **Advanced Functionality** – Your site is out of control (just kidding) with functionality.  An example of this would be: a store with inventory control, advanced payments on your site, or just all around the most advanced site that your developer ever built.  We can [talk](http://mikefontenot.me/contact) about this before the decision is made to go with this service.
  - **Other** - There may be something you identify during our initial review of your site.

## Advanced Migration Service Overview

You have spent time with a developer, or yourself, and built the most impressive and complex site for your business and want that evaluated and migrated correctly the first time.  We want you to be happy with this service and your new site and will work hard to get you there.  Since this is the most expensive option, we will work with you very closely before deciding this is the path we take.

Here is our idea of how we should plan the process.

  - **Contact Us** – The first step is to contact us to talk about your project (include a link to the site you plan to migrate). You can send me an [email](http://mikefontenot.me/contact) or give me a call at 337-577-1683 (we will return calls within 24 hours on working days).
  - **10-15 Minute Site Review** – After hearing from you, we will take a 10-15 minute look at your existing site and determine if it is a match for the advanced migration service.  We will gather questions along with any our initial recommendations at this stage.
  - **Initial Consultation** – After our initial review, we can schedule a call to discuss findings, get answers to our questions, and answer your questions. Here is where we can discuss costs and timeline and make sure that we are a match for each other (it is possible we may not be, and that is okay).  If we decide to go forward, you’ll pay for a website evaluation and I’ll put it on my schedule.
    Website Evaluation – Now that we’ve started work together, I’ll tackle the evaluation at the scheduled time. During the evaluation, I work carefully through each of the pages on your site (or unique template in cases where we’re dealing with hundreds or thousands of pages), identifying functionality to be migrated, noting areas where I have questions, and crafting a detailed plan for carrying out the work. This is the most important part of the process and I don’t hold back. At the end of the evaluation, I present my findings and recommendations to you as a detailed action plan, along with a fixed cost for my team and I to carry out the work and a timeline for when we can get it done.
