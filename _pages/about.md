Hi, my name is Mike and here is my very short story.

For years (dial-up days) I have been tinkering with websites.  My passion continues to be anything to do with a computer, whether it's simple repairs, troubleshooting software, or programming.  That aside, my absolute joy is the ability to reach a global audience with my work, and that is where the web comes in.  I finished a course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com) rightly-named ["The Complete Web Developer Course"](https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/learn/).  It was awesome and only inspired me more to start a small business offering WordPress services to others needing assistance.

Please consider me to help you with your WordPress site.  See my [services page](http://mikefontenot.me/services) for offerings and to give me a quick idea on what you need help with.  I look forward to working with you!
